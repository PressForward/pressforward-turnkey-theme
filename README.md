## Theme Requirements
This standalone wordpress theme is based on [Brew](https://github.com/slightlyoffbeat/brew), a Bootstrap and HTML5 Wordpress theme by Dan Wild. 

## Installation
Please note: There have been reports of a known issue with uploading the theme due to the size of the file. If you get an error regarding the upload size limit and downloaded the theme prior to July 13th, please re-download the theme and try again. If you continue to get an error, please upload the theme via your ftp client or clone the theme into your wp-content/themes directory using git rather than through the WordPress theme upload option. We are working on a fix for this and will update the installation instruction when this issue has been resolved. While PHP sometimes prevents the upload of the theme due to its size, uploading the theme through FTP still works and the theme will still be fully functional. 

This theme is not avaialable in the WordPress Directory but it is functional and can be installed by downloading or cloning this repository into the Themes directory of your WordPress install. Setup can be completed by using the PressForward Options Panel in the WordPress dashboard.  [See the setup guide](https://github.com/PressForward/PressForward-TurnKey-Theme/wiki) for more information on how to setup the theme. 



## Support
